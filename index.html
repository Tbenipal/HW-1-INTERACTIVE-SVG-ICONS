        <div id="bkground2"><p id="paragraph">Quatro was a canned, fruit-flavoured carbonated drink produced from 1982 to 1989 in the United Kingdom. From 1983 to 1989 it was commonly available in the UK, though production and sale of the drink ceased there in the mid-1980s. Green in colour, its name derived from the four fruits used: pineapple, orange, passion fruit and grapefruit. The current incarnation of the Quatro brand has been sold and marketed in South America by The Coca-Cola Company, since 1996. It is grapefruit-flavoured, and is sold in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay.</p></div>
